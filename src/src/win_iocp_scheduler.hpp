/** Windows IOCP-based scheduler service.

    This scheduler uses Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) to manage
    asynchronous work items. Work items are posted to the completion
    port and dequeued during run() calls.

    IOCP provides efficient, scalable I/O completion notification and
    is the foundation for high-performance Windows I/O. This scheduler
    leverages IOCP's thread-safe completion queue for work dispatch.

    @par Thread Safety
    This implementation is inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads
    may call post() concurrently, and multiple threads may call
    run() to dequeue and execute work items.

    @par Usage
    @code
    io_context ctx;
    auto& sched = ctx.use_service<win_iocp_scheduler>();
    // ... post work via scheduler interface
    ctx.run();  // Processes work via IOCP
    @endcode

    @note Only available on Windows platforms.
