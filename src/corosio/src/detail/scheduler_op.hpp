/** Abstract base class for completion handlers.

    Handlers are continuations that execute after an asynchronous
    operation completes. They can be queued for deferred invocation,
    allowing callbacks and coroutine resumptions to be posted to an
    executor.

    Handlers should execute quickly - typically just initiating
    another I/O operation or suspending on a foreign task. Heavy
    computation should be avoided in handlers to prevent blocking
    the event loop.

    Handlers may be heap-allocated or may be data members of an
    enclosing object. The allocation strategy is determined by the
    creator of the handler.

    @par Ownership Contract

    Callers must invoke exactly ONE of `operator()` or `destroy()`,
    never both:

    @li `operator()` - Invokes the handler. The handler is
        responsible for its own cleanup (typically `delete this`
        for heap-allocated handlers). The caller must not call
        `destroy()` after invoking this.

    @li `destroy()` - Destroys an uninvoked handler. This is
        called when a queued handler must be discarded without
        execution, such as during shutdown or exception cleanup.
        For heap-allocated handlers, this typically calls
        `delete this`.

    @par Exception Safety

    Implementations of `operator()` must perform cleanup before
    any operation that might throw. This ensures that if the handler
    throws, the exception propagates cleanly to the caller of
    `run()` without leaking resources. Typical pattern:

    @code
    void operator()() override
    {
        auto h = h_;
        delete this;    // cleanup FIRST
        h.resume();     // then resume (may throw)
    }
    @endcode

    This "delete-before-invoke" pattern also enables memory
    recycling - the handler's memory can be reused immediately
    by subsequent allocations.

    @note Callers must never delete handlers directly with `delete`;
    use `operator()` for normal invocation or `destroy()` for cleanup.

    @note Heap-allocated handlers are typically allocated with
    custom allocators to minimize allocation overhead in
    high-frequency async operations.

    @note Some handlers (such as those owned by containers like
    `std::unique_ptr` or embedded as data members) are not meant to
    be destroyed and should implement both functions as no-ops
    (for `operator()`, invoke the continuation but don't delete).
