/** A mock socket for testing I/O operations.

    This class provides a testable socket-like interface where data
    can be staged for reading and expected data can be validated on
    writes. Two mockets are connected together using @ref make_mockets,
    allowing bidirectional communication testing.

    When reading, data comes from the peer mocket's `provide()` buffer.
    When writing, data is validated against this mocket's `expect()` buffer.
    Once both buffers are exhausted, I/O passes through to the underlying
    socket connection.

    @par Thread Safety
    Not thread-safe. All operations must occur on a single thread.
    All coroutines using the mockets must be suspended when calling
    `expect()` or `provide()`.
