/** An I/O context for running asynchronous operations.

    The io_context provides an execution environment for async operations.
    It maintains a queue of pending work items and processes them when
    `run()` is called.

    The nested `executor_type` class provides the interface for dispatching
    coroutines and posting work items. It implements both synchronous
    dispatch (for symmetric transfer) and deferred posting.

    @par Thread Safety
    Distinct objects: Safe.@n
    Shared objects: Safe, if using a concurrency hint greater than 1.

    @par Example
    @code
    io_context ioc;
    auto ex = ioc.get_executor();
    run_async(ex)(my_coroutine());
    ioc.run();  // Process all queued work
    @endcode
