/** Windows IOCP-based platform reactor service.

    This reactor uses Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP) to manage
    asynchronous work items. Work items are posted to the completion
    port and dequeued during process() calls.

    IOCP provides efficient, scalable I/O completion notification and
    is the foundation for high-performance Windows I/O. This reactor
    leverages IOCP's thread-safe completion queue for work dispatch.

    @par Thread Safety
    This implementation is inherently thread-safe. Multiple threads
    may call submit() concurrently, and multiple threads may call
    process() to dequeue and execute work items.

    @par Usage
    @code
    io_context ctx;
    ctx.make_service<win_iocp_reactor>();
    // ... submit work via platform_reactor interface
    ctx.run();  // Processes work via IOCP
    @endcode

    @note Only available on Windows platforms.

    @see platform_reactor
