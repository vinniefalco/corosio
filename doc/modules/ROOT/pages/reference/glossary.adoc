= Glossary

This glossary defines terms used throughout the Corosio documentation.

== A

Acceptor::
An I/O object that listens for and accepts incoming TCP connections. See
`corosio::acceptor`.

Affine Awaitable::
An awaitable type that implements the affine protocol, receiving a dispatcher
parameter in `await_suspend` to ensure correct executor affinity.

Affinity::
The binding of a coroutine to a specific executor. A coroutine with affinity
to executor `ex` will have all its resumptions dispatched through `ex`.

any_bufref::
A type-erased reference to a buffer sequence, allowing non-template code to
work with any buffer type.

any_dispatcher::
A type-erased wrapper for dispatchers, enabling runtime polymorphism for
executor types.

Awaitable::
A type that can be used with `co_await`. Must provide `await_ready()`,
`await_suspend()`, and `await_resume()` methods.

== B

Buffer::
A contiguous region of memory. See `capy::mutable_buffer` (writable) and
`capy::const_buffer` (read-only).

Buffer Sequence::
A collection of buffers that can be iterated. Enables scatter/gather I/O
with a single operation.

== C

Cancellation::
The ability to abort an in-progress asynchronous operation. Operations
complete with an error code indicating cancellation.

Completion::
The event when an asynchronous operation finishes, either successfully or
with an error.

Composed Operation::
An operation built from multiple primitive operations. For example,
`corosio::read()` repeatedly calls `read_some()` until the buffer is full.

Concurrency Hint::
A value passed to `io_context` indicating how many threads may call `run()`.
Affects internal synchronization strategy.

Continuation::
The code that runs after an asynchronous operation completes. In coroutines,
this is the code following `co_await`.

Coroutine::
A function that can suspend and resume execution. Uses `co_await`, `co_yield`,
or `co_return` keywords.

Coroutine Handle::
A low-level handle to a suspended coroutine, represented by
`std::coroutine_handle<>`.

== D

Dispatcher::
An object that can dispatch coroutine handles for execution. Satisfies the
`capy::dispatcher` concept.

== E

Endpoint::
A combination of IP address and port number identifying a network destination.
See `corosio::endpoint`.

EOF (End of File/Stream)::
A condition indicating no more data is available. Signaled by
`capy::error::eof`.

Error Category::
A grouping of related error codes. Boost.System uses categories to
distinguish different error sources.

Error Code::
A lightweight error indicator. See `boost::system::error_code`.

Error Condition::
A portable error classification. Enables comparing errors across categories.

Execution Context::
An environment where work runs. Provides service management and an executor.
See `capy::execution_context`.

Executor::
An object that can dispatch work for execution. Satisfies the `capy::executor`
concept.

== H

Handle::
A reference to a system resource (socket, file, etc.) managed by the
operating system.

Handler::
A callback function or coroutine handle that runs when an operation completes.

== I

I/O Context::
The main event loop in Corosio. Processes asynchronous operations and
dispatches completions. See `corosio::io_context`.

I/O Object::
A class representing an I/O resource (socket, timer, etc.). Base class is
`corosio::io_object`.

I/O Stream::
An I/O object that supports reading and writing data. Base class is
`corosio::io_stream`.

io_result::
The result type for Corosio operations, containing an error code and optional
values. Supports structured bindings.

IOCP (I/O Completion Ports)::
Windows kernel mechanism for scalable asynchronous I/O. Used by Corosio on
Windows.

== L

Lazy::
A coroutine or operation that doesn't start until explicitly triggered.
`capy::task` is lazy—it starts when awaited.

== M

Mocket::
A mock socket for testing. See `corosio::test::mocket`.

Move-Only::
A type that can be moved but not copied. Sockets and other I/O objects are
move-only.

== O

Operation::
An asynchronous action that completes in the future. Returns an awaitable
that can be `co_await`ed.

Outstanding Work::
Work tracked by an I/O context. The context's `run()` continues while
outstanding work exists.

== P

Platform Backend::
The operating system-specific implementation (IOCP, io_uring, kqueue).

Poll::
Processing ready work without blocking. See `io_context::poll()`.

Post::
Queuing work for later execution. See `executor_type::post()`.

Primitive Operation::
A basic I/O operation like `read_some()` or `write_some()` that may transfer
any amount of data.

== R

Resolver::
An I/O object that performs DNS lookups. See `corosio::resolver`.

Resume::
Continuing execution of a suspended coroutine.

Run::
Processing the event loop. See `io_context::run()`.

== S

Scatter/Gather I/O::
Reading into or writing from multiple non-contiguous buffers in a single
operation.

Service::
A polymorphic component owned by an execution context. Provides shared
functionality.

Signal Set::
An I/O object that waits for operating system signals. See
`corosio::signal_set`.

Socket::
An I/O object for TCP network communication. See `corosio::socket`.

Stop Token::
A mechanism for requesting cancellation. See `std::stop_token`.

Stream::
A sequence of bytes that can be read or written incrementally.

Structured Bindings::
C++17 feature for unpacking tuple-like types: `auto [a, b] = expr;`

Suspend::
Pausing execution of a coroutine, yielding control to the caller.

Symmetric Transfer::
A tail-call optimization where one coroutine directly resumes another without
stack growth.

== T

Task::
A lazy coroutine that produces a value. See `capy::task<T>`.

Thread Safety::
The ability to use an object safely from multiple threads. Individual I/O
objects are generally not thread-safe.

Timer::
An I/O object for scheduling delays. See `corosio::timer`.

TLS (Transport Layer Security)::
Cryptographic protocol for secure communication. See `corosio::wolfssl_stream`.

Type Erasure::
Hiding concrete types behind an abstract interface. Enables runtime
polymorphism without templates.

== W

Wait::
An operation that suspends until a condition is met (timer expires, signal
received, etc.).

WolfSSL::
A compact TLS library used by Corosio for secure streams.

Work::
Pending operations that keep an I/O context running.
