# Coroutine-First I/O Execution Model



## System Properties

Optimized for coroutines-first, other models secondary

**HALO will improve:** Clang is best at HALO, and we should assume other compilers will eventually get there

## Definitions

**Definition:** An `io_object` reflects operating-system level asynchronous operation which completes through a platform-specific reactor

**Requirement:** A coroutine signals execution affinity by participating in the affine awaitable protocol

**Requirement:** An `io_object` resumes the calling coroutine by using its dispatcher, provided during await_suspend

**Implication:** Because the `io_object` always resumes through the dispatcher, a coroutine at `final_suspend` is guaranteed to be executing on its own executor's context. When returning to a caller with the same executor (`caller_ex_ == ex_`), symmetric transfer can proceed without a `running_in_this_thread()` check—pointer equality is sufficient. When executors differ, `final_suspend` must dispatch through the caller's executor.



## Executor Operations

An executor is to coroutines what an allocator is to memory. An executor encapsulates rules for where, when, and how a coroutine resumes. Lightweight, copyable handle to an execution context (thread pool, strand, system threads, etc.). There are three basic operations:

- `dispatch`: Run inline if allowed, else queue. Cheapest path. Use when crossing execution context boundaries (e.g., I/O thread completing an operation, resuming a coroutine on the user's executor). Runs inline if executor rules permit, otherwise queues.

- `post`: Always queue, never inline. Use when you need guaranteed asynchrony — resumption must not happen inline. Rarely needed for coroutines.

- `defer`: Always queue, but hints "this is my continuation" — enables tail-call/thread-local optimizations. Use when resuming a coroutine from within the same executor context and you must go through the executor (e.g., strand enforcement, different associated executors in chain). Optimizes as continuation via thread-local queue.

- **symmetric transfer**: Prefer over all three when caller and callee share the same executor and no strand/ordering constraints apply. Direct tail call, zero overhead, no executor involvement.

In a pure coroutine model, symmetric transfer handles continuation chaining directly — the compiler generates tail calls between frames, no executor involvement. `defer` is an executor-based optimization that becomes redundant when you can just return the next coroutine handle.

### Decision order:

1. Same executor, no constraints → symmetric transfer
2. Crossing context boundary → dispatch
3. Same executor, must use executor (strand, etc.) → defer
4. Need guaranteed async → post



## Flow Diagrams

A _flow diagram_ signifies a composed asynchronous call chain reified as a series of co_awaits.

* Coroutines are lazy and indicated by `c`, `c1`, `c2`, ...
* `io_object` are represented as `io`, `io1`, `io2`, ...
* Foreign awaitable contexts are represented as `f`, `f1`, `f2`, ...
* `co_await` leading to an `io_object` are represented by arrows `->`
* `co_await` to a foreign context are represented by `\`
* Executors are annotated `ex`, `ex1`, `ex2`, ...
* A coroutine with _executor affinity_ is preceded by `!`



This call chain:
```
c -> io
```
represents (ordinals are left out when singular):
```
task c(io_object& io) { co_await io.op(); }
```


This call chain:
```
c1 -> c2 -> io
```
represents:
```
task c1(io_object& io) { co_await c2(io); }
task c2(io_object& io) { co_await io.op(); }
```



A coroutine can await a foreign context, to send work elsewhere:
```
c1 -> c2 -> io
        \
         f
```
for example a CPU-bound task to not block the io thread:
```
task c1(io_object& io) { co_await c2(io); }
task c2(io_object& io) { co_await f(); co_await io.op(); }
```



A coroutine preceded by an exclamation point in a flow diagram has _executor affinity_, or just _affinity_. It is a lazy coroutine, and its call to resume is dispatched through `ex`. The execution model offers an invariant: the later call to resume `c` happens through the executor `ex`, obtained through `co_await io.op()` (affine awaitable protocol).
```
!c1 -> io
```
achieved by (`run_on` is notional)
```
task c1(io_object&);
//...
run_on( ex, c1(io) );
```
Affinity propagates forward through the affine awaitable protocol. The initial coroutine in the chain captures the typed executor by value, and propagates it by reference forward. A coroutine created in this fashion captures the type-erased affine dispatcher and propagates it forward. This continues to the `io_object` where it is stored and used later when the operation completes.

Subsequent coroutines in a flow diagram representing I/O execution
have inherited affinity unless annotated with an exclamation point indicating that
their affinity has changed:
```
!c1 -> c2 -> !c3 -> io
```
represents
```
task c1(io_object& io) { co_await c2(io); }
task c2(io_object& io) { co_await run_on( ex2, c3(io) ); }
task c3(io_object& io) { co_await io.op(); }
```
The `run_on` function is notional, representing an awaitable means of awaiting a new coroutine on the same `io_object`, on a different executor `ex2`. What must happen here is the following:
- `c1` is launched on `ex1` (implied)
- `c2` continues in `ex1` implicitly
- `c3` is launched on `ex2` explicitly
- `io` captures the type-erased `ex2`
- When the I/O completes, `c3` is resumed through `ex2`
- When `c3` returns, `c2` is resumed through `ex1`
- When `c2` returns, its dispatcher compares equal to `c1`'s dispatcher and the transfer is symmetric; `ex1` is not invoked





## Allocation Model

C++20 coroutines support frame allocation customization through operator new and operator delete in the promise type. The call:
```
co_await f();
```
Calls the simple `operator new` and `operator delete`:
```
struct promise_type {
    void* operator new(std::size_t size) { return ::operator new(size); }
    void operator delete(void* ptr, std::size_t size) { ::operator delete(ptr, size); }
};
```

The coroutine's arguments can be used to overload these operators. The call:
```
co_await f(std::allocator_arg, alloc, x);
```
Invokes allocator-aware `operator new`, where `std::allocator_arg_t` is the conventional detection tag:
```
struct promise_type {
    template<typename Allocator, typename... Args>
    void* operator new(std::size_t size, std::allocator_arg_t, Allocator alloc, Args&&...);
    
    template<typename Allocator, typename... Args>
    void operator delete(void* ptr, std::size_t size, std::allocator_arg_t, Allocator, Args&&...);
};
```
Allocator-aware `operator new` stores the allocator in the frame (appended after `size` bytes); matching `operator delete` recovers it for deallocation. If allocation fails and `get_return_object_on_allocation_failure()` exists in the promise, it is called instead of throwing. Compilers may elide frame allocation entirely (HALO) when coroutine lifetime is provably bounded by the caller.
